SobekCM METS EDITOR

-------------------------

ABOUT

This application is used to view and edit METS files for 
digital resources which will ultimately appear under the 
UFDC technology. This allows users to edit nearly all of 
the possible data fields for an item, and update data for 
an existing item.

When this application is installed, the extension .mets is 
associated with this application. Once installed, you can 
open or edit METS files using this application by clicking 
on the file in the windows directory.

There are several default templates installed with the 
application. Each template can present a very different look. 
A template dictates which elements to show and, in the case 
where there are several different formats available, which 
format to use. The template also determines how the exposed 
elements are grouped. Finally, templates can also set defaults 
and possible values.
